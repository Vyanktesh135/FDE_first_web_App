    "- You must parse the file content using appropriate parser\n",
    "- Choose a chunking strategy, and split the content,\n",

    "# 🔍 What is File Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "File Search is a built-in capability that lets models look into your uploaded documents before generating an answer. Instead of relying only on the model’s internal knowledge, you can expand its context by giving it access to your own files. It supports both semantic (meaning-based) and keyword search, ensuring that the model retrieves the most relevant information from your knowledge base. File search simplifies this entire process. It’s a hosted tool available through the Responses API that lets you query your knowledge base directly and receive responses grounded in retrieved information — without manually orchestrating the retrieval steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll show how to upload PDFs into an OpenAI-managed vector store and use file search to automatically pull the right context when answering questions. To illustrate this, we’ll begin by creating a small set of queries derived from PDFs extracted from OpenAI’s news articles.\n",

      "Deep Research is a new capability introduced by OpenAI that enables multi-step research tasks conducted through its ChatGPT platform. It allows users to conduct extensive research on complex topics, synthesizing information from various online sources efficiently and effectively. Here's a breakdown of what it entails:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Functionality**: Deep Research works autonomously to find, analyze, and compile information across the internet, generating comprehensive reports akin to that of a research analyst. This capability is leveraged by an optimized version of OpenAI's upcoming model suited for web browsing and data analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **User Applications**: It is designed for individuals engaged in intensive knowledge work—such as in finance, science, policy, and engineering—who require precise and reliable research. It can also assist consumers seeking personalized recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Output**: The reports generated by Deep Research are documented with citations and a summary of the model's reasoning, facilitating easy reference and verification of the information.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Limitations**: While it offers significant capabilities, Deep Research is still in the early stages and may occasionally produce incorrect facts or struggle with distinguishing authoritative information from rumors. Addressing these limitations is part of its ongoing development.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Access and Usage**: Initially available to Pro users, Deep Research can handle multiple queries and is designed for tasks that typically require considerable time investment. Users can approach tasks with just a single query and receive notifications when the research is complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Deep Research aims to enhance the efficiency of knowledge acquisition and analysis, moving toward more complex task execution as part of the broader vision to develop advanced AI capabilities.\n"

Here's a breakdown of what it entails:\\n\\n1. **Functionality**: Deep Research works autonomously to find, analyze, and compile information across the internet, generating comprehensive reports akin to that of a research analyst. This capability is leveraged by an optimized version of OpenAI's upcoming model suited for web browsing and data analysis.\\n\\n2. **User Applications**: It is designed for individuals engaged in intensive knowledge work—such as in finance, science, policy, and engineering—who require precise and reliable research. It can also assist consumers seeking personalized recommendations.\\n\\n3. **Output**: The reports generated by Deep Research are documented with citations and a summary of the model's reasoning, facilitating easy reference and verification of the information.\\n\\n4. **Limitations**: While it offers significant capabilities, Deep Research is still in the early stages and may occasionally produce incorrect facts or struggle with distinguishing authoritative information from rumors. Addressing these limitations is part of its ongoing development.\\n\\n5. **Access and Usage**: Initially available to Pro users, Deep Research can handle multiple queries and is designed for tasks that typically require considerable time investment. Users can approach tasks with just a single query and receive notifications when the research is complete.\\n\\nOverall, Deep Research aims to enhance the efficiency of knowledge acquisition and analysis, moving toward more complex task execution as part of the broader vision to develop advanced AI capabilities.\", type='output_text', logprobs=[])], role='assistant', status='completed', type='message')], parallel_tool_calls=True, temperature=1.0, tool_choice='auto', tools=[FileSearchTool(type='file_search', vector_store_ids=['vs_692fedb450dc8191b5b5180d687cdc29'], filters=None, max_num_results=20, ranking_options=RankingOptions(hybrid_search=None, ranker='auto', score_threshold=0.0))], top_p=1.0, background=False, conversation=None, max_output_tokens=None, max_tool_calls=None, previous_response_id=None, prompt=None, prompt_cache_key=None, reasoning=Reasoning(effort=None, generate_summary=None, summary=None), safety_identifier=None, service_tier='default', status='completed', text=ResponseTextConfig(format=ResponseFormatText(type='text'), verbosity='medium'), top_logprobs=0, truncation='disabled', usage=ResponseUsage(input_tokens=16423, input_tokens_details=InputTokensDetails(cached_tokens=0), output_tokens=394, output_tokens_details=OutputTokensDetails(reasoning_tokens=0), total_tokens=16817), user=None, billing={'payer': 'developer'}, prompt_cache_retention=None, store=True)"

Only include open\\ufffesource information as of October 1, 2024.\\r\\nPure vs. mixed-gas sorption in glassy polymers: In a glassy polymer\\r\\n(below ), a single gas typically exhibits a concave sorption isotherm:\\r\\nuptake rises sublinearly with pressure, unlike the linear Henry’s-law\\r\\nbehavior above . This is attributed to “dual-mode” sorption: some\\r\\npenetrant dissolves in the dense polymer matrix (obeying Henry’s law)\\r\\nwhile additional penetrant saturates specific microvoid “sites” (a\\r\\nLangmuir-type adsorption in the polymer’s nonequilibrium free\\r\\nvolume). By contrast, when two or more gases are present,they\\r\\ncompete forthose limited Langmuir sorption sites.As a result, each\\r\\ncomponent’s sorbed concentration in a mixture is generally lower\\r\\nthan it would be at the same partial pressure alone.\", vector_store_id='vs_692fedb450dc8191b5b5180d687cdc29'), Result(attributes={}, file_id='file-XVAGedV4hUDf7VUnVWWCZ5', filename='Introducing deep research _ OpenAI.pdf', score=0.6894, text='For example, in CO₂/CH₄ mixtures both components sorb\\r\\nless than in their pure-gas cases (especially CH₄), so the CO₂/CH₄\\r\\nsorption selectivity is higher under mixture conditions.

For a single\\r\\ngas,the sorbed concentration (e.g. in cm³(STP) gas per cm³\\r\\npolymer) is written as:\\r\\nHere is the Henry’s law coefficient for dissolution, is the\\r\\nLangmuir capacity constant (proportional to the polymer’s unrelaxed\\r\\nfree-volume or “hole” capacity), and is the Langmuir affinity\\r\\nconstant. This empirical formula yields the characteristic concave\\r\\nisotherm of glassy polymers and reduces to simple Henry’s law at the\\r\\nglass-transition (since as ). The same three\\r\\nparameters ( ) are obtained by fitting pure-gas sorption data\\r\\nand are then used to predict mixture sorption. For a binary mixture of\\r\\ngases A and B (with partial pressures ),the DMS model\\r\\nassumes each gas obeys its own Henry’s term and that both compete\\r\\nforthe same Langmuir sites. One convenient form is to write the total\\r\\nsorbed concentration as the sum of contributions from each gas:\\r\\nwhich implicitly means the concentration of component i in the\\r\\nmixture is . This reduces to the single-gas\\r\\nformula when the other component’s pressure is zero. In practice,\\r\\npartial pressure in these equations is often replaced by fugacity for\\r\\naccuracy at high pressures,though using fugacities or pressures gives\\r\\nnearly the same results if applied consistently. The DMS mixed-gas\\r\\nmodel predicts the competitive sorption effect observed\\r\\nexperimentally – namely, each gas’s uptake is depressed relative to its\\r\\npure-gas sorption isotherm.\\r\\nChallenges and limitations: Although the dual-mode model is widely\\r\\nsuccessful in correlating sorption data, it has notable limitations in\\r\\nC\\r\\nC(p) = kD p + . 1+b p\\r\\nC b p H\\r\\n′\\r\\nkD CH\\r\\n′\\r\\nb\\r\\nCH\\r\\n′ → 0 T → Tg\\r\\nkD, C , b H\\r\\n′\\r\\npA, pB\\r\\nCtot = kD,ApA + kD,BpB + , 1+bApA+bBpB\\r\\nCH b p + C b p ,A ′ A A H,B ′ B B\\r\\nCi = kD,ipi + 1+∑ b p j j j\\r\\nCH b p ,i ′ i i\\r\\n09/03/2025, 14:36 Introducing deep research | OpenAI\\r\\nhttps://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/ 12/36predicting sorption behavior.

Please discuss the differences between pure\\ufffeand mixed-gas sorption for glassy polymers, how the dual-mode\\r\\nsorption model can be used to predict mixed-gas sorption behavior in\\r\\nglassy polymers (include equations where applicable), and what\\r\\nchallenges there are in accurately predicting pure- and mixed-gas\\r\\nsorption using the dual-mode sorption model. Only include open\\ufffesource information as of October 1, 2024.\\r\\nPure vs. mixed-gas sorption in glassy polymers: In a glassy polymer\\r\\n(below ), a single gas typically exhibits a concave sorption isotherm:\\r\\nuptake rises sublinearly with pressure, unlike the linear Henry’s-law\\r\\nbehavior above . This is attributed to “dual-mode” sorption: some\\r\\npenetrant dissolves in the dense polymer matrix (obeying Henry’s law)\\r\\nwhile additional penetrant saturates specific microvoid “sites” (a\\r\\nLangmuir-type adsorption in the polymer’s nonequilibrium free\\r\\nvolume). By contrast, when two or more gases are present,they\\r\\ncompete forthose limited Langmuir sorption sites.As a result, each\\r\\ncomponent’s sorbed concentration in a mixture is generally lower\\r\\nthan it would be at the same partial pressure alone. In particularthe\\r\\nless soluble (lower-affinity) gas tends to be more strongly suppressed,\\r\\noften causing the mixed-gas solubility selectivity (ratio of\\r\\nconcentrations) to exceed the ideal value predicted from pure-gas\\r\\nisotherms. For example, in CO₂/CH₄ mixtures both components sorb\\r\\nless than in their pure-gas cases (especially CH₄), so the CO₂/CH₄\\r\\nsorption selectivity is higher under mixture conditions. In extreme\\r\\ncases, mixed-gas effects can even reverse performance trends\\r\\nobserved with single gases. (We note that unlike competitive sorption,\\r\\nsynergistic sorption – where one gas increases the sorption of another\\r\\nTg\\r\\nTg\\r\\n09/03/2025, 14:36 Introducing deep research | OpenAI\\r\\nhttps://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/ 11/36via polymer swelling – is usually minor in rigid high-free-volume\\r\\npolymers under moderate pressures.)\\r\\nDual-mode sorption model and mixed-gas prediction: The dual-mode\\r\\nsorption (DMS) model quantitatively captures glassy polymer sorption\\r\\nby superposing a Henry’s-law term and a Langmuirterm. For a single\\r\\ngas,the sorbed concentration (e.g. in cm³(STP) gas per cm³\\r\\npolymer) is written as:\\r\\nHere is the Henry’s law coefficient for dissolution, is the\\r\\nLangmuir capacity constant (proportional to the polymer’s unrelaxed\\r\\nfree-volume or “hole” capacity), and is the Langmuir affinity\\r\\nconstant. This empirical formula yields the characteristic concave\\r\\nisotherm of glassy polymers and reduces to simple Henry’s law at the\\r\\nglass-transition (since as ).
