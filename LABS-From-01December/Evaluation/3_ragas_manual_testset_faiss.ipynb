    "   - Optional: Load a PDF using `PyPDFLoader`\n",
    "   - Fallback: Use sample in-memory texts\n",
    "2. **Chunking & Indexing**\n",
    "   - Split into chunks with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`\n",
    "   - Create a **FAISS** vector store using **OpenAI embeddings**\n",
    "3. **RAG Pipeline (FAISS + OpenAI)**\n",
    "   - Retrieve top-k chunks\n",
    "   - Pass them as context to LLM model\n",
    "4. **Manual Testset Builder**\n",
    "   - Build your own testset with columns:\n",
    "     - `question`\n",

    "Intuition: “Does the answer actually respond to the user’s question?”\n",
    "\n",
    "High relevancy → answer is on-topic, focused, and directly addresses the question.\n",
