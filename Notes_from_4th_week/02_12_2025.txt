# RAG (Retrival Agumented Generation)
    - Retrival + Generation
    - Retrive data from Vector data base or Documets(PDF , image , etc..) 
                    + 
            User Prompt
    using above 2 entity LLM generates the output which can say as RAG

Usefull to get the latest and Private data and then process with LLM

## Advanced RAG techniques
1. Reranking Retrival Chunks (Get the initial retrived some records and ask another smart model or algorithm to reorder it)
    a. Vector Search = recall (get many pausible candidates)
    b. Reranker = precision (Sort them by usefulness)
    
2. Hypothetical document embedding
3. Graph RAG
4. Hybrid RAG = Vector DB + Graph RAG
